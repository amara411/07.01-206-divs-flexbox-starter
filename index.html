                <p>I was born in Louisiana and raised in Alabama, but my real roots reach all the way to Africa. I owe my travel bug to my father who traveled to America and put down his roots. His job allowed him to travel the world - I was so grateful when he would let our family tag along!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-2">
                <p>My passion: I abosolutely LOVE music - it's one of the most powerful and diverse methods for communication and expression. I sing daily and you can find me always blasting music. I just went to Beyonc√©'s concert and feel inspired to attend at least one concert a month! It was everything I could've ever hoped for and more!!</p>

            <div class="div-3">
                <p>A fun fact: As a southern lady, you would think that I would basically be a mermaid because I lived so close to the ocean for most of my life. Well that would be a false statement. I learned how to swim about 5 years ago. Since then, I've gone snorkeling with dolphins and surfing with sea turtles! I'm looking forward to learning how to scuba dive in a cenote!</p>
