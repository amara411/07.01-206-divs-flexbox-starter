                <p> I am a <span>Responsive Designer & Developer</span> who enjoys telling visual stories. When I'm not working, pursuing side projects, or getting lost in a book, I can be found traveling, hiking, working out, and spending time with friends.</p>

                <p>I was born in Louisiana and raised in Alabama, but <span>my real roots</span> reach all the way to Africa. I owe my travel bug to my father who traveled to America and put down his roots. His job allowed him to travel the world - I was so grateful when he would let our family tag along!</p>

            <div id="div-2" class="flex-items">
                <p><span>My passion:</span> I abosolutely LOVE music - it's one of the most powerful and diverse methods for communication and expression. I sing daily and you can find me always blasting music. I just went to Beyonc√©'s concert and feel inspired to attend at least one concert a month! It was everything I could've ever hoped for and more!!</p>

            <div id="div-3" class="flex-items">
                <p><span>A fun fact:</span> As a southern lady, you would think that I would basically be a mermaid because I lived so close to the ocean for most of my life. Well that would be a false statement. I learned how to swim about 5 years ago. Since then, I've gone snorkeling with dolphins and surfing with sea turtles! I'm looking forward to learning how to scuba dive in a cenote!</p>
